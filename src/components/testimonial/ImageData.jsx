I wasn’t sure where to start with florals and design, but she helped walk me through the process. I sent her my tropical floral inspiration pictures from Pinterest and she brought them to life and made them look even better!! She even helped me pick some options that were budget friendly. The entire process was effortless with Harolyn. My wedding was an absolute dream because of her and I’m so thankful I picked her! Thank you so much!!”`,
